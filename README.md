# BERT-MFT: Mask Fine-Tuning for BERT

## Overview

BERT-MFT (Mask Fine-Tuning) is a novel approach to analyzing and modifying BERT models by identifying and selectively zeroing parameters that naturally trend toward zero during training. This technique preemptively removes parameters that would decay during fine-tuning, potentially improving model efficiency without traditional training. We demonstrate that that influence functions (second-order analysis) significantly outperform gradient-based methods (first-order analysis) for identifying redundant parameters in neural networks. Our research reveals that neural networks learn "anti-knowledge" - parameters that actively harm model performance - and that these can be identified and removed to improve accuracy.

## Key Discovery

**Removing certain parameters IMPROVES model accuracy by up to 24%**. This counter-intuitive finding proves that some parameters add noise rather than useful information, particularly in moderately-trained models.

## Research Question

To what extent can structured masking of parameters in fully fine-tuned large language models be beneficial to predictive accuracy across language tasks?

## Methodology

### Gradient Method (First-Order)
- Identifies parameters moving toward zero: |θ - lr*∇θ| < |θ|
- Simple but flawed: high false positive rate
- Misses crucial parameter interactions

### Influence Functions (Second-Order)
- Computes: influence = ∇L_val^T × H^(-1) × v_j
- Considers how other parameters compensate when one is removed
- Successfully identifies noise-adding parameters
- Adapts methodology from "What Data Benefits My Classifier?" (Chhabra et al.) to parameter valuation

## Experimental Results

### Model Performance After Parameter Removal

| Model Checkpoint | Baseline Accuracy | Optimal Removal | Best Accuracy | Improvement | Parameters Removed |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 60% checkpoint | 60.44% | 5,000 params | 84.86% | +24.43% | 0.005% of model |
| 75% checkpoint | 77.52% | 10,000 params | 87.38% | +9.86% | 0.009% of model |
| 85% checkpoint | 85.20% | 10,000 params | 81.42% | -3.78% | 0.009% of model |
| 88% checkpoint | 88.53% | 100 params | 79.24% | -9.29% | 0.0001% of model |
| 90% checkpoint | 90.83% | 100 params | 80.96% | -9.86% | 0.0001% of model |

### False Positive Rate Analysis

| Model Checkpoint | Gradient Detrimental | Influence Beneficial | False Positive Rate |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 60% checkpoint | 32,095 | 21,638 | 31.8% |
| 75% checkpoint | 36,153 | 23,738 | 33.7% |
| 85% checkpoint | 128,215 | 109,975 | 14.0% |
| 88% checkpoint | 210,432 | 178,485 | 15.1% |
| 90% checkpoint | 151,547 | 133,587 | 11.8% |

### Critical Insights

1. **Optimal Accuracy Range**: Models trained to 60-75% accuracy benefit most from influence-based parameter removal
2. **Anti-Knowledge Discovery**: Less-optimized models contain more harmful parameters that can be safely removed for performance gains
3. **Model Fragility**: Highly-optimized models (85%+ accuracy) become fragile - removing even beneficial parameters hurts performance
4. **Catastrophic Failure**: Models at 88-90% accuracy collapse completely when more than 500 parameters are removed

Theoretical Foundation
The influence function for parameter removal is computed as:
I(θ_i) = -∇L_val^T · H^(-1) · e_i · θ_i

Where:

∇L_val: Gradient of validation loss
H^(-1): Inverse Hessian matrix (captures parameter interactions)
e_i: Unit vector for parameter i
θ_i: Parameter value

This formulation adapts data valuation techniques to parameter importance, considering how the loss landscape changes when parameters are removed.
Implications for Model Optimization
For Model Compression

Train models to 70-75% accuracy rather than maximum accuracy
Apply influence-based parameter identification
Remove beneficial parameters for accuracy gains AND model size reduction
Achieve better performance with smaller models

For Understanding Neural Networks

Neural networks learn both helpful and harmful patterns
Training beyond certain accuracy thresholds eliminates removable "anti-knowledge"
Second-order effects are crucial for understanding parameter importance
Traditional gradient-based pruning methods are fundamentally flawed

Future Research Directions

Investigate layer-wise patterns: Which layers contain the most anti-knowledge?
Apply to other architectures: Test on GPT, ResNet, Vision Transformers
Develop training strategies: Can we prevent anti-knowledge formation during training?
Scale to larger models: Test on BERT-large, GPT-3 scale models
Combine with other compression techniques: Integration with quantization, distillation
